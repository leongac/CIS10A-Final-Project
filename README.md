## [1] Summary

For my final project I am designing a class registry system.  User enter the application.
Select the classe, and his/her schedule for that semester is print out for him/her.

The schedule include: Student's information (Name, Student ID), classes, classroom for the 
class, Time of the class, teacher, and number of units.

## [2] Class Designed
There 4 type of object here:
Student,
Professor,
Classes,
Classroom.

Each object has its variable, method and constructor.

The challenge is how to store the data.  I am thinking of using array.  Other option 

include use the build in Java List class or the like.  I am open to suggestions.

The Professor, classes and classroom will be created and predefine before the student is 
using the system.

New students are added each time a student uses the application, but I am not sure how to 

pertint the state of these object.  Still thinking about this part.
